Overview: Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is a plant pathogenic virus. It is found worldwide and affects tomatoes and many other plants. 


Symptoms: 


* The foliage of affected tomato plants shows mottling, with alternating yellowish and darker green areas.
* The leaves tend to be fern-like in appearance with pointed tips and younger leaves may be twisted.
* The fruit may be distorted, yellow blotches and necrotic spots may occur on both ripe and green fruit and there may be internal browning of the fruit wall.
* The entire plant may be dwarfed and the flowers discolored.


Prevention: 


* Sanitation is the most important application to practice when controlling tomato  mosaic virus.
* Tools should be boiled for 5 minutes and then washed with a strong detergent.
* Destroy any seedlings that appear stunted or distorted and then decontaminate tools and hands.
* Treating mosaic virus is difficult and there are no chemical controls like there are for fungal diseases, although some varieties of tomato are resistant to the disease.
