Overview:  Cedar apple rust is a fungal disease that requires juniper plants to complete its complicated two-year life-cycle and it cannot spread between apple trees. 
Symptoms: On apple and crab-apple trees, there are pale yellow pinhead-sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. 
Prevention: 
* Choose resistant cultivars when available.
* Removing galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.
* spraying plants with a copper solution 
* Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides.
