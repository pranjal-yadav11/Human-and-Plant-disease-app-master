Overview: Late blight caused by the fungus and is the most important disease of potato that can result into crop failures in a short period if appropriate control measures are not adopted. 
Symptoms: 
* Small water-soaked spots develop at the tips, margins or any other part of the leaf which enlarge to form irregular dark brown lesions
* A whitish cottony growth of the fungus is visible around the dark brown lesions
* The lesions also appear on the stem near the growing point
* The infection can also start at nodes and extend both up and down the stem and the plant topples


Prevention: 


* a timely application of fungicide
* Eliminate sources of inoculum such as hairy nightshade weed species and volunteer potatoes.
* Avoid planting problem areas that may remain wet for extended periods or may be difficult to spray
* Destroy all cull and volunteer potatoes.
* Do not mix seed lots because cutting can transmit late blight.
* Avoid excessive and/or nighttime irrigation
