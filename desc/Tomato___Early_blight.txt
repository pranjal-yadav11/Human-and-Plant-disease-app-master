Overview: Early blight is one of the most common tomato and potato diseases, occurring nearly every season.It affects leaves, fruits and stems and can be severely yield-limiting when susceptible tomato cultivars are used and weather is favorable.Severe defoliation can occur.  In tomatoes, fruit can be damaged by sun.
Symptoms: 
* Initially, small dark spots form on older foliage near the ground. Leaf spots are round, brown and can grow up to 1/2 inch in diameter.
* Severely infected leaves turn brown and fall off, or dead, dried leaves may cling to the stem.
* Larger spots have target-like concentric rings. The tissue around spots often turns yellow.
* Fruit spots are leathery and black, with raised concentric ridges.


   Preventation: 
* Cover the soil under the plants with mulch, such as fabric, straw, plastic mulch, or dried leaves.
* Water at the base of each plant, using drip irrigation, a soaker hose, or careful hand watering.
* Increase airflow by staking or trellising, removing weeds, and spacing plants adequately apart
* Pruning the bottom leaves can also prevent early blight spores from splashing up from the soil onto leaves.
