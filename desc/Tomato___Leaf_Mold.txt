OVERVIEW: 
* Tomato leaf mold is typically only an issue in greenhouse and high-tunnel tomatoes.
* The disease is driven by high relative humidity (greater than 85%).
* Foliage is often the only part of the plant directly infected. Infection will cause infected leaves to wither and die, indirectly affecting yield.


Symptoms: 
* Pale greenish-yellow spots, usually less than 1/4 inch, with no definite margins, form on the upper sides of leaves.
* Olive-green to brown velvety mold forms on the lower leaf surface below leaf spots.
* Infected blossoms turn black and fall off.


Preventation: 
* Fungicide applications should be made prior to infection when environmental conditions favor disease to be the most effective.
*  It is important to alternate between different chemical families to avoid the development of pathogen resistance to particular active ingredients.
* Use drip irrigation and avoid watering foliage.
* Space plants provide good air movement between rows and individual plants.
