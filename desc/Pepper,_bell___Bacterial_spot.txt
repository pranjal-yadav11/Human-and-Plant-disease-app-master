Overview: Bacterial spots can be a devastating disease when the weather is warm and humid. The disease can affect all above-ground parts of tomato and pepper plants: stems, petioles, leaves, and fruits. 
Symptoms: 
* Pepper leaves have small (less than 1/8 inch), brown, circular spots that do not have a yellow halo and centers do not fall out.
* Small, brown, circular spots may also occur on stems and the fruit calyx.
* Pepper fruit spots often occur on the stem-end of the fruit.
* Spots occur on green and red fruit but do not result in rot.
Prevention: 
1. Monitoring the bacterial spot: Look for leaves with spots, especially during periods of wet, humid weather and remove leaves with symptoms.
2. Resistant varieties: There are many varieties of bell pepper and hot pepper with resistance to bacterial spots. Use these after reading the labels properly and following them.
3. Cultural practices: If starting your own seeds, choose seeds from a reputable supplier. Space plants so that air flows between them. Remove or bury plants at the end of the season.
