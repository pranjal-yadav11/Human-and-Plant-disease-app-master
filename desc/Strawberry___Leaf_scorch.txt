Overview: Scorched strawberry leaves are caused by a fungal infection which affects the foliage of strawberry plantings. Strawberries with leaf scorch may first show signs of issue with the development of small purplish blemishes that occur on the topside of leaves.
Symptoms: 
* Small, dark purple spots develop on upper leaf surfaces and remain dark purple.
* Spots have an irregular outline. If numerous, spots run together, and leaves appear scorched.
* Infected fruit has elongated, slightly sunken, reddish areas or streaks.
Prevention: 
* Remove the infected garden debris from the strawberry patch, as well as the frequent establishment of new strawberry transplants.
* The creation of new plantings and strawberry patches is key to maintaining a consistent strawberry harvest, as older plants are more likely to show signs of severe infection.
* Use proper plant spacing to provide adequate air circulation and the use of drip irrigation.
