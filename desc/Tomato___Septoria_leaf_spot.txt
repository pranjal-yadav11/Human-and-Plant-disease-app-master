Overview: Tomatoes are also susceptible to Septoria leaf spot, one of the most common disease of tomatoes.


Symptoms: 
* Symptoms usually appear on leaves, but can occur on petioles, stems, and the calyx.
* The first symptoms appear as small, water-soaked, circular spots 1/16 to 1/8" in diameter on the undersides of older leaves.
* affected leaves turn yellow and eventually shrivel up, brown, and drop off.
* The spots are distinctively circular and are often quite numerous. 


 Prevention: 
* remove or destroy as much of the tomato debris as possible after harvest in the fall. 
* If infected plants are found, rogue the seedlings before transplanting them into the field.
* Fungicides are very effective for control of Septoria leaf spot and applications are often necessary to supplement the control strategies.
