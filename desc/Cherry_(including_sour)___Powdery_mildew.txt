Overview: Powdery mildew of cherry is caused by fungus. Mid- and late-season sweet cherry cultivars are commonly affected, because these get a covering of white fungal growth on the cherry surface due to this fungus.
Symptoms: Initial symptoms are light roughly-circular, powdery looking patches on young, susceptible leaves (newly unfolded, and light green expanding leaves). Leaves may become distorted, curling upward. Severe infections may cause leaves to pucker and twist.
Preventation: 
Cultural control: 
* Manage irrigation: Pruning will also help to achieve good spray coverage.
* Pruning: Pruning will  help to achieve good spray coverage and to control humidity effect.
Chemical control: Consider post-harvest preventative measures to obstruct the fungus from overwintering. Most synthetic fungicides are preventative, not eradicative.
