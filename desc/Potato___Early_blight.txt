Overview: Early blight of potato is caused by the fungal pathogen. The disease affects leaves, stems and tubers and can reduce yield, tuber size, storability of tubers, quality of fresh-market and processing tubers and marketability of the crop.
Symptoms: 
*  small, circular or irregular, dark-brown to black spots on the older (lower) leaves
* These spots enlarge up to 3/8 inch in diameter and gradually may become angular-shaped.
* Appearing of  lesions on young, fully expanded leaves
Prevention: 
* the application of locally systemic and translaminar fungicides often is necessary for control at high levels of disease pressure, especially under irrigation.
* Select a late-season variety with a lower susceptibility to early blight. 
* Rotate foliar fungicides
* Avoid nitrogen and phosphorus deficiency.
* Eradicate weed hosts such as hairy nightshade to reduce inoculum for future plantings.
