Overview: 
* TB bacteria usually attack the lungs and become active if the immune system can’t stop them from growing. When TB bacteria are active (multiplying in your body), this is called TB disease.
* TB bacteria are spread through the air from one person to another. The TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, or sings. People nearby may breathe in these bacteria and become infected.
* TB disease in the lungs or throat can be infectious. This means that the bacteria can be spread to other people. TB in other parts of the body, such as the kidney or spine, is usually not infectious.


Symptoms: 
TB bacteria usually grow in the lungs (pulmonary TB). TB disease in the lungs may cause symptoms such as
* a bad cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer
* pain in the chest
* coughing up blood or sputum (phlegm from deep inside the lungs)
Other symptoms of TB disease are
* weakness or fatigue
* weight loss
* no appetite
* chills
* fever
* sweating at night
Prevention : 
If you have active TB, it generally takes a few weeks of treatment with TB medications before you're not contagious anymore. Follow these tips to help keep others from getting sick:
* Stay home
* Ventilate the room. 
* Cover your mouth. 
* Wear a face mask.
* Take medications; don’t skip any dose otherwise TB bacteria have a chance to develop mutations that allow them to survive the most potent TB drugs.
