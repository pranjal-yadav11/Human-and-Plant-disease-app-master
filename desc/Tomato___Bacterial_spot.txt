Overview: Bacterial spot can occur wherever tomatoes are grown, but is found most frequently in warm, wet climates, as well as in greenhouses. These bacterial pathogens can be introduced into a garden on contaminated seed and transplants. The pathogens enter plants through natural openings (e.g., stomates), as well as through wounds.Bacterial spot pathogens can survive well in tomato debris, but they survive very poorly in soil when not associated with debris.


Symptoms: 
* Bacterial spot appears on leaves as small (less than ⅛ inch), sometimes water-soaked circular areas.
* Spots may initially be yellow-green, but darken to brownish-red as they age.  
* When the disease is severe, extensive leaf yellowing and leaf loss can also occur.
Preventation: 
* Soak seeds in water at 122°F for 25 min. to kill the pathogens. 
* to prevent the spread of the pathogens, avoid overhead watering of established plants and instead use a drip-tape or soaker-hose.
* sterilize tools with either 10% bleach solution or (better) 70% alcohol (e.g., rubbing alcohol).  
* consider using preventative applications of copper-based products registered for use on tomato.
