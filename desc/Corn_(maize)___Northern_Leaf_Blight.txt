Overview: Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB), can cause yield loss if it develops before or during the tasseling and silking phases of corn development. Hybrid susceptibility, cropping practices, and weather strongly influence disease development.
Symptoms: 
* long, narrow, tan lesions that form parallel to leaf margins.
* The classic symptoms of NCLB will be observed: long, oblong, or “cigar-shaped” tan or grayish lesions.
* Multiple lesions may form on a leaf, and lesions can coalesce to form large, irregular areas of dead tissue on the leaves.
* Disease symptoms vary by hybrid susceptibility.
Prevention: 
* Select Resistant Hybrids: Choose a hybrid with moderate resistance to NCLB. 
* Manage Residue: Production practices that encourage residue to decompose will reduce the amount of fungus present to infect the next corn crop.
* Use Fungicides Effectively: Fungicides are available for in-season management of NCLB. Fungicides vary in their chemical properties, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI), so it is important to read and follow all label directions and restrictions before fungicide application.
