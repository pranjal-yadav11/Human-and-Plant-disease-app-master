Overview: Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia. 
Syptoms: 
* Chest pain when you breathe or cough
* Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)
* Cough, which may produce phlegm
* Fatigue
* Fever, sweating and shaking chills
Prevention: 
* Get vaccinated - Vaccines are available to prevent some types of pneumonia and the flu. Talk with your doctor about getting these shots.
* Practice good hygiene. To protect yourself against respiratory infections that sometimes lead to pneumonia, wash your hands regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
* Keep your immune system strong. Get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet.
