Overview: Common corn rust is the most frequently occurring of the two primary rust diseases of corn. Occasionally field corn does become severely affected when weather conditions favor the development and spread of the rust fungus. 
Symptoms: Symptoms can be easily recognized and distinguished from other diseases by the development of dark, reddish-brown pustules scattered over both the upper and lower surfaces of the corn leaves. These may appear on any ground part of the plant, but are most abundant on the leaves. 
Prevention : In seasons where considerable rust is present on the lower leaves prior to silking and the weather is unseasonably cool and wet, an early fungicide application may be necessary for effective disease control. Numerous fungicides are available for rust control.
