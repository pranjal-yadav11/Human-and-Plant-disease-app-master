Overview:  target spot of tomato is a fungal disease that attacks a diverse assortment of plants, including papaya, peppers, and squash as well as passion flower and certain ornamentals. Target spot on tomato fruit is difficult to control because the spores, which survive on plant refuse in the soil, are carried over from season to season.


Symptoms: tomatoes ripen and turn from green to red, the fruit displays circular spots with concentric, target-like rings and a velvety black, fungal lesions in the center. The “targets” become pitted and larger as the tomato matures.


Prevention: 
* Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season;
* Pay careful attention to air circulation, as target spot of tomato thrives in humid conditions.
* Rotate crops and don’t plant tomatoes in areas where other disease-prone plants have been located in the past year
* Water tomato plants in the morning so the leaves have time to dry.
