Overview: Black rot is a name used for various diseases that produce dark brown discoloration and decay in the leaves of fruit and vegetables. The disease begins when bacteria are splashed onto leaves by rain or irrigation water, multiplying to form large populations.
Symptoms: Black rot symptoms initially appear as yellow to light brown patches at leaf margins; veins later darken in infected leaves. Infected leaves later turn brown and dry out. Vascular tissues become brown as bacteria move throughout the plant.
Prevention: 
* Cultural control: 
1. Plant high-quality seed and transplants free from the black rot bacterium
2. Deeply bury crop residues to speed decomposition. 
3. Avoid sprinkler irrigation where possible    
* Chemical control: 
Copper-based bactericides provide some suppression of black rot. Bactericides are most effective when used in combination with cultural control strategies.
