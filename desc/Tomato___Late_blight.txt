Overview: Late blight is a water mold.
* Late blight favors cool (60°F to 70°F), damp conditions. Prolonged hot dry days can halt pathogen spread.
* The most common routes of introduction each season are infected potato seed tubers, infected tomato transplants shipped in from other regions.
Symptoms: 
* Leaves have large, dark brown blotches with a green gray edge; not confined by major leaf veins.
* Infections progress through leaflets and petioles, resulting in large sections of dry brown foliage.
* Stem infections are firm and dark brown with a rounded edge.
* In tomatoes, firm, dark brown, circular spots grow to cover large parts of fruits. Spots may become mushy as secondary bacteria invade.
Prevention: 
* Scout tomatoes regularly and remove diseased leaves
* Remove or bury plants at the end of the season. Manage cull piles so culls break down over winter.
* Keep leaves as dry as possible.
